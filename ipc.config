# This is the IPC matrix, defining the task IPC
# permissions for current tasks. You can set it
# using the following:
# - ipc send are read line by line, sender at left
# - ipc recv are read column by column, receiver at top
# - if the value of a cell is set to 1, IPC is allowed
# - any other value means that the share is not allowed
#
# This matrix is converted into a static const matrix in
#Â C and Ada defining the permissions of all tasks
