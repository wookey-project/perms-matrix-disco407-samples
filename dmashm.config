# This is the DMA SHM matrix, defining the task DMA SHM declaration
# permissions for current tasks. You can set it
# using the following:
# - DMA SHM declaration are read line by line, emiter at left
# - DMA SHM peer are read column by column, peer at top
# - if the value of a cell is set to 1, the share is allowed
# - any other value means that the share is not allowed
#
# This matrix is converted into a static const matrix in
#Â C and Ada defining the permissions of all tasks
